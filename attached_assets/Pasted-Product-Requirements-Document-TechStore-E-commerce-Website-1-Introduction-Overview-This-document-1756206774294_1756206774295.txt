Product Requirements Document: TechStore E-commerce Website
1. Introduction & Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a new full-stack e-commerce website for TechStore, a trusted gadget and electronics store. The goal is to create a functional, single-page application that allows users to browse and purchase tech products. The site will be built with a MERN stack, offering a modern and dynamic user experience. A key focus is to implement robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to manage the product inventory effectively. User authentication is not a required feature for this initial version.

2. Goals & Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to create a fully functional, end-to-end e-commerce platform for tech products. Specific goals include:

Provide a seamless user experience for browsing gadgets, viewing technical details, and adding items to a cart.

Establish a robust backend capable of managing tech product data via a MongoDB database.

Enable full CRUD functionality for the product catalog, allowing for easy inventory management of electronics and accessories.

Demonstrate proficiency with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and modern front-end styling.

3. Target Audience
The target audience for this website is two-fold:

End Users (Customers): Individuals who are tech enthusiasts, students, or professionals looking to purchase gadgets, laptops, phones, and accessories. They expect a clean, intuitive interface that is easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices.

Store Administrators: The individual or team responsible for managing the tech product inventory. They require a simple interface to add, edit, and delete products from the catalog.

4. Key Features & Functionality
4.1. Product Catalog (Read)
This feature allows end users to view the available products.

Product Listing Page: Displays all products in a grid or list format. Each product item will include:

Product image

Product name (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro", "AirPods Pro 2")

Price

A brief description or key feature summary

Product Detail Page: When a user clicks on a product, they are taken to a dedicated page with more information, including:

High-resolution product images

Detailed technical specifications (e.g., processor, RAM, storage, display type)

Full price

"Add to Cart" button

4.2. Product Management (CRUD)
This set of features is for the store administrator to manage inventory. A simple administrative interface will be implemented.

Create: The administrator can add a new tech product to the catalog by providing the following information via a form:

Product Name

Detailed Description & Specifications

Price

Image URL

Stock Quantity

Read: The administrative interface will display a list of all current products, making them easy to review.

Update: The administrator can edit the details of an existing product. Clicking on a product in the admin view will pre-fill a form with its current data, which can then be modified and saved.

Delete: The administrator can permanently remove a product from the catalog.

4.3. Shopping Cart
While user authentication is not required, a functional shopping cart will be included to manage the user's selected items.

Add to Cart: A button on the Product Detail Page adds the selected product to a temporary, session-based cart.

View Cart: A dedicated page or modal will show the items currently in the cart, along with their quantity and a running total.

Checkout: A simple "Checkout" button will be available in the cart. This will be a non-functional placeholder for future development, as a full payment system is out of scope.

5. Technical Requirements
Frontend: The client-side application will be built using React.js. The application will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.

Styling: The design and layout will be implemented using either Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive, mobile-first design.

Backend: The server-side will be built with the MERN stack, specifically using Node.js and the Express.js framework to handle API endpoints.

Database: MongoDB will be used as the database to store product data, taking advantage of its flexible NoSQL schema.

API: A RESTful API will be created to connect the frontend and backend, handling all CRUD operations for the product data.

6. Scope & Exclusions
In Scope:

Full-stack development using the MERN stack.

All CRUD functionality for the product catalog.

A basic, session-based shopping cart.

Responsive front-end design.

Out of Scope:

User registration and login (authentication).

Any form of payment processing or e-commerce transactions.

Order history or user-specific data persistence.

Complex search and filtering functionality.

Reviews and ratings.

Full product inventory management beyond basic stock quantity tracking.
